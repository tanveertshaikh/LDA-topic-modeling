1) Your approach for solving a task should use machine learning and the concepts we have learned in class. For example, features should not be handpicked but picked by an algorithm. 

 

2) For the required portions of HW 5, the only figures you should include in your one-page write-up should be related to evaluation, e.g., learning curves. If you would like to visualize the data itself, you are welcome to include such visualizations only in the extra credit portion. 

 

3) If you decide to submit a notebook for extra credit, please share your private repositories with me and the TA's. For github, share with zynnel, ragib06, and shizhan1992. For bitbucket, share with zynnel, rahsan3, and zhanshi.



Be sure to answer the following questions: (a) what is your data and task? (b) what ML solution did you

choose and, most importantly, why was this an appropriate choice? (c) how did you choose to evaluate

success? (d) what software did you use and why did you choose it? (e) what are the results? (f) show

some examples from the development data that your approach got correct and some it got wrong: if

you were to try to fix the ones it got wrong, what would you do?

I thought following links could be helpful for us to analyse and start working on Young people survey dataset specifically the second option of  Spending habits. I thought of sharing the links
